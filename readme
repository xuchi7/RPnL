Please run "main.m" in this folder.

In "main.m", we tested 6 experiments.
The defined flags for the experiments are as follows:
- a1; % centered (outlier-free)
- a2; % uncentred (outlier-free)
- b1; % nLine = 4
- b2; % nLine = 5
- c1; % centered (with outliers)
- c2; % uncentred (with outliers)

for each experiment, the code does the following:
(1) generate testing data (3d lines, their 2d projectons, and groundtruth), 
	and store it in "testData" folder
(2)	load the testing data, test the compared methods, and store the results 
	(mean & median rotation & translation errors, correct-rate, execution time) 
	in "resData" folder
(3) load the results in "resData" folder, and plot the figures
